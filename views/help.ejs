          National Veterinary Institute (NVI) was established at Bishoftu in
          1964 with 40 persons under the Ministry of Agriculture, getting
          technical assistance from the French Government through the French
          Veterinary Mission in Ethiopia. At that time, the real value of the
          NVI for the welfare of the national animal resources and for the
          African continent is not well known by most of the people. Today it
          is one of the most well known veterinary vaccine producing
          institutions in Africa with its multidisciplinary professional staff
          having long years of experience. The infrastructure of NVI is well
          developed and playing an important role in the attraction of
          international institution,the Pan African Veterinary Vaccine Control
          Center (PANVAC) which is under the African Union. Moreover,it has
          been given the responsibility to produce and supply enough vaccines
          for PTA(Preferential Trade Area) countries of Eastern, Western and
          Southern Africa.The institute has reached the level of using state
          of the art equipments and materials for biological production and
          vaccine related research. Since the creation of the institute,
          several million doses of different vaccines have been produced and
          dispatched to protect millions of animals from various infectious
          diseases.According to the evaluation performed in 1983 by IEMVT
          (Institute Dâ€™Elvage et de Medicine Veterinaire de pays Tropicaux)on
          the production potential of African laboratories,NVI was graded as
          the biggest vaccine producing center of all veterinary laboratories
          in tropical Africa. Moreover the institute won the International
          Gold Mercury Award in 1982 in recognition of its positive
          contribution to national development at the 22nd conference for
          peace and cooperation. Gold Medal award from the Ministry of Science
          Technology. Different medals and certificate award from the
          Government and non- Government Organizations, Professional
          Associations and Universities. The National Veterinary Institute was
          organized as public enterprise by the Proclamation No. 25/1992 and
          Council of Ministers Regulations No. 52/1999. National Science,

          <p> The institute possesses more than 57 years of experience in the
            production and distribution of veterinary biological products for
            both domestic and international markets (to more than 26 African
            countries). The vaccine production capacity of the institute in the
            early years was about 4 million doses per year, but currently it has
            a capacity of producing more than 350,000,000 doses. The institute
            has total surface area of 40 hectare of land. NVI actively takes
            part in problem identification, and look for solution by developing
            and promoting research products to alleviate livestock diseases
            related problem and at the same time to protect animal welfare and
            the environment. Ordinarily the institute works harmoniously with
            the national veterinary service delivering institutions being as a
            stakeholder of the discipline. The institute has been working in
            collaboration with the national and international institutes on
            vaccine development and improvement, vaccine production,pathogen
            identification and characterization,and other related technology
